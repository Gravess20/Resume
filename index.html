           <p>I am a truck driver with a Class A Commercial Drivers License.  I ran over the road dry van trailers for the first year of driving, and for the last two Iâ€™ve been on a dedicated account for Prime Source using a curtain side flatbed to deliver an array of building materials.  My role requires me to pick up and secure loads at early hours and make timely deliveries throughout the day, driving four to five hundred miles a day.  I keep a daily record of inspections for both tractor and trailer to ensure daily operation.</p>
